Hi this is a Ben Eater 6502 with vga video card.
I dont have any more time to work on this project, but if you want you can.
Disclaimer: I'm not a coder or hardware engineer, i'm a civil engineer, this was a hobby project.
The computer can load and save to a spi eeprom, but it's not in the schematics, i didn't had the time to update the changes.
